AWS Cloud Networking Project

In this project i'm creating 2 seperate VPC with they own subnets in the same AWS Cloud Regions with the helps of VPC Peering Connection so that the instance of each respective VPC are able to communicate and exchanges data.

I also added an AWS tracking tool, CloudWatch and VPC Flow Logs
